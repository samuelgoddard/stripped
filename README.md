stripped is a very stripped (heh) down OOSCSS/BEM based boilerplate that i use for the majority of my project starts. it includes pretty much nothing but the (in my opinion) bare essentials for the majority of the small projects i work on and is regularly updated by myself and a couple of friends. More information on the approach can be found [here](https://www.impression.co.uk/blog/4327/object-oriented-front-end-framework/)

### installation.
To install, simply download or fork the files, run `npm install` and `grunt` and you're good to go. if you are unfamiliar with either of these you can find more information on [grunt here](http://gruntjs.com/) and [npm here](https://www.npmjs.com/). As previously mentioned, this is a stripped down boilerplate, so feel free to add your own dependencies etc through npm and you're own production variables to the gruntfile.

### documentation.
Coming soon... for now ask me any questions via github.
